        At an early age I was not allowed to eat spicy food. "Flamin' 
        Hot Cheetos" had been invented one year previously in 1992, and although
        my pallette had not been developed, it was certainly an 
        ideal time to be brought into the world. 
        Behind the scenes MKULTRA and the Cheetos corporation 
        were working on something big, I would later credit my 
        mutant abilities to their experimentation.

        Mecha-Chester has interfaced with the internet and monitors the world like a living god. The resistance has consolidated its forces in

			<h2>The End <br> 2024</h2>
			<p>In October of 2024 the Solar Flare finally hit. With their robots diminished our ground forces were quickly able to take the Cheetos World headquarters. 
        The God had been blinded, for the first time in years I felt free of the madman's gaze. We worked swiftly, trying to instate a new 
        government inside the infastructure of the Cheetos Corporation, but the real challenge was to find and kill Mecha-Chester before he was able to reboot. 
        Our Intelligence teams had placed Mecha-Chester in a deep bunker in the Balkans - I was to lead our strike forces through to end it all. Victory felt so close- but when we stormed the stronghold we realized that he had been toying with us all along.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mecha-Chester had been consolidating his power- spending the last 10 years constructing a bio-machine that would amplify his psychic abilities to a universal scale. He sat at his throne, an engorged monster with veiny wires that covered the walls, floors and ceilings of his vast compound.
        With a passing glance he melted our ground teams, and suddenly he was in my mind - all around me I felt his presence. He stretched the moments of my pain into what felt like 10 lifetimes - but I knew that somehow I was still with him - in that exact moment. 
        I knew that if he survived he would learn to transcend time, and eventually he would come to control every concievable domain in this Dimension and Beyond. 
        I pressed with every ounce of my psychic being into the pain, and eventually I felt a tiny rupture, a crack. His laughter bellowed all around me, but his taunts could only mean one thing -he was afraid.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pressed to it's limits and at the edge of bursting, my mind reached out, pleading, hoping that some god other than this freak would hear me. First just a whisper, a small hand grabbed my own. 
        I hear murmurs around me. The souls of the fallen have come to rally behind me- they surrounded me with love. 
        Tears stream down my face as my heart fills with gratitude and Mecha-Chester begins to drown. 
        We both realize there is no way our universe will survive this struggle, 
        but at least his hunger for power will be quelled- an eneternity of suffering will be avoided.
        A moment before this climax, there is a instance of peace. Chester faces me. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        "It ain't easy bein' Cheesy"
        <br>
        <br>
        Then there is nothing.
